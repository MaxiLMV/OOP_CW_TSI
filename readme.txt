# Object Oriented Programming Course Project

This project was a month-long assignment done at the end of the second quarter of 2023. The task was to develop an application based on a topic of choice. The chosen topic was "Convienience store management app".

The app is currently non-functional as the online SQL database is offline at the moment.
